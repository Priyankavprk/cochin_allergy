                  <p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of airways, in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.</p>
                  <p>The prevalence of asthma was one percent in 1964 in the country. But, new data as per WAO (World Allergy Organization) shows that about 14 per cent people now have asthma .The way these are occurring, WAO believes, that by 2050, about 50 percent of all children will have some sort of allergies.</p>

                          <p>Asthma disease has constellation symptoms. The symptoms that are perceived by us are mainly coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and night awakening, that makes the tip of the iceberg .These symptoms respond well to the short term asthma reliever medications for example bronchodilators.
                   Other symptoms that are constantly present in asthmatic patients are difficulty in breathing out, airway hypersensitivity, excess mucus production and swollen airway. These symptoms do not alarm an asthmatic as they become use to these symptoms. For reduction of underlying airway swelling and these symptoms, it is necessary to use preventer medications regularly.</p>
                  <p>Asthma treatment consist of two basic classes of medications
                    <ul>
                      <li>Rescuer or reliever medications</li>
                      <li>Preventer medications</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rescuer medications dilate the tubes of the lungs and are called bronchodilators. They give immediate relief from symptoms but their effect last only for 4 to 6 hours</p>
                  <p>Preventer medication control asthma attacks and control asthma better. These medications reduces inflammation and widens the air tube that help in reduction of the symptoms</p>
                  <p>So that preventer medications should be taken regularly till the doctor advice it to be stopped.</p>

                  <p><strong>Unresponsive Asthma</strong><br/>
                  Antiasthma therapy is very effective in treating and controlling asthma symptoms but few patients fail to respond, and continue experiencing troublesome asthma related symptoms even on taking asthma medications on regular basis.</p>
                  <p>The reason behind unresponsiveness is commonly due to the wrong inhaler technique, tobacco smoke, significant environmental allergen exposure and significant occupational exposure.</p>
                  <p>Beside this some drugs for example beta blockers, NSAIDS, ACE inhibitors produces asthma like symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Any concurrent disease for example gastroesophageal reflux disease, COPD, chronic sinusitis, rhinitis, systemic disease, thyrotoxicosis and vasculitis may be the cause of poor symptom control.</p>

                  <p><strong>Complicated Asthma</strong><br/>
                  Although most asthma patients respond well to comprehensive treatment, a few with symptoms and signs of severe asthma supported by objective evidence of obstructive airway disease will have a decidedly inadequate response to treatment. Less than 5% of asthma patients are diagnosed with severe asthma. Among these, some fail to respond to even aggressive asthma management. Such patients are often treated with daily oral corticosteroids, and many become steroid dependent. However, some severe asthma patients have a poor response to even high doses of glucocorticosteroids. Many become steroid-dependent. The term steroid-resistant asthma has been applied to asthma patients who have little or no objective response (improvement in FEV1‚) to even prolonged treatment of high-dose glucocorticosteroids.</p>
                  <p>It is now clear  that the category of severe unresponsive asthma is heterogenous and includes not only steroid-resistant asthma, but also other severe asthmatics that are affected by various co morbidities (e.g., GERD, chronic sinusitis, paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction, bronchopulmonaryaspergillosus, psychopathology, uncontrolled triggers {allergens and pollution} immunodeficiency, etc.). These patients may benefit from a consultation at a major academic canter (e.g., National Jewish Health) for a second opinion, always searching for a solution.</p>

                  <p><strong>Brittle asthma</strong><br/>
                Is a rare form of severe asthma characterized by a wide variation of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), in spite of heavy doses of steroids.</p>
                  <p>Brittle asthma is classified in two types: type 1 characterized by a maintained wide PEF variability (> 40% diurnal variation for > 50% of the time over a period of at least 150 days) despite maximal medical therapy.</p>
                  <p>Type 2 is characterized by acute attacks occurring within minutes that could lead to death, with a background of well controlled asthma.</p>

                    Non allergic asthma is more likely to occur in subjects 4 years or older than 60 years of age. Episodes are triggered by ongoing inflammation, by upper respiratory infection, purulent rhinitis and exacerbation of chronic rhinitis. Most patients have no evidence of IgE antibodies. Indoor air pollution from volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde and wood burning stoves are the trigger factor.</p>

                      <p>Asthma is caused by swelling in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. Less air is able to pass through as a result.</p>
                      <p>Asthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together.</p>

                          When the child is having hard time breathing, the skin of the chest and neck may suck inward.

                        <p>Other symptoms of asthma in children include:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Coughing that sometimes wakes the child up at night (it may be the only symptom)</li>

                        Your child’s asthma symptoms may vary. Symptoms may appear often or else develop only when triggers are present. Some children are more likely to have asthma symptoms at night.

              <li>Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms.</li>
