                  <p>Acute Urticaria is said to affect 10 to 20 % of population at sometime during life, it is most common in young adults. It is also known as hives, are an outbreak of swollen, pale, red, bumps, patches on the skin that appear suddenly-either as a result of allergies or for other reasons.</p>
                  <p>Episodes of Urticaria occurring at least twice a week for six weeks are considered to be chronic.</p>
                  <p>Acute Urticaria is defined as persisting for less as 6 weeks where as chronic Urticaria refers to episodes lasting more than 6 months.Chronic urticaria is a clinical skin affection marked by wheals, erythema and itching that appear transiently or persist up to 24 hours, and recur for 6 weeks or more. Health- related quality of life is significantly influenced by recurrence and duration of patient symptoms.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>The precipitating stimuli may include pressure, stroking [dermographism], water immersion [ aquagenicurticaria], solar ultraviolet radiation, cold exposure, increase in central body temperature[ fever, physical effort, sweating, cholinergic urticaria]. Ingested chemical substances known to induce mast cell degranulation,e.g. salicylates, preservatives, opiates and non-steroidal antiphlogistics, are often implicated in the chronicity and flare-ups. Chronic bacterial and viral infections [Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia enterocolitica, hepatitisB, Epstein-Bar virus and possibly chronic focal infections in the ear-nose- throat region] or collagen vascular diseases can produce the clinical condition of chronic urticaria.</p>
                  <p>Acute infections can play a role in the production and exacerbation of the urticaria. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis and otitis are often due to staphylococci and streptococci are associated with chronic urticaria that have been treated by proper treatment.</p>
                  <p>Food additives and preservatives have a further role in the severity of chronic urticaria symptoms.</p>
                  <p>In a report of 3-17 years old children, 75% of the causes of urticaria severity were due to food additives such as coloring agents, preservatives, monosodium glutamate and sweetener agents such as saccharine/ cyclamate.Sometimesurticaria reaction occurs following consumption of food products [allergy] aeroallergens like birch tree sensitivity, because there is a cross-reactivity between foods especially fruits and vegetables and aeroallergens.These conditions are ruled out in the clinic and appropriate treatment is initiated.Angioedema is similar to hives, but the swelling occurs beneath the skin instead of on the surface. Angioedema is characterized by deep swelling around the eyes, lips and sometimes of genitals, hands and feet.Swelling generally last longer usually go away in 24 hours</p>

                        <p>ASST test is performed by your doctor in the clinic. The patient’s venous blood is placed in sterile plastic tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes. Then the serum was separated by centrifugation at 500 x g for 15 minutes and kept in aliquots for use in the ASST. Sample (50 µl) of autologous serum and 0.9% sterile saline (for negative control) were separately injected intradermally into the volar aspect of the patient’s forearm skin with 27G needle, leaving gaps of at least three centimetres. A skin prick test with histamine (10 µg/µl) was used as a positive control. Areas known to have been involved in spontaneous wheals in the last 24 hours were avoided. Skin prick tests with histamine were interpreted after 15 minutes. Wheals and flare responses were measured after 30 minutes. A positive ASST was defined as a serum-induced wheal which was both red and had a diameter of 1.5 mm or more than the saline-induced response at 30 minutes</p>

                         <p>Atopic dermatitis most often begins in childhood before age 5 and may persist into adulthood. For some, it flares periodically and then subsides for a time, even up to several years. Itching may be severe, and scratching the rash can make it even itchier and cause more inflammation. Once the skin barrier is broken, the skin can become infected by bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus, which commonly live on the skin. Breaking this itch-scratch cycle can be challenging.</p>

                                   <p><strong>Neurodermatitis</strong> Prolonged itching and scratching may increase the intensity of the itch, possibly leading to neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus). Neurodermatitis is a condition in which an area of skin that’s frequently scratched becomes thick and leathery. The patches can be raw, red or darker than the rest of your skin. Persistent scratching can also lead to permanent scars or changes in skin color.</p>
                                   <p><strong>Skin infections</strong> Sometimes, scratching can break the skin and cause open sores and fissures that can become infected, a process called impetiginisation. A milder form of infection is impetigo, usually due to staphylococcal infection. Having atopic dermatitis predisposes you to this infection.</p>
                                   <p><strong>Eye complications</strong> Severe atopic dermatitis can also cause eye complications, which may lead to permanent eye damage. When these complications occur, itching in and around the eyelids becomes severe. Signs and symptoms of eye complications also include eye watering and inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis) and the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis). If you suspect complications with your eyes, see your doctor promptly.</p>

                    <p>Contact dermatitis(CD) is a common skin disorder marked by erythematous, vesicular, popular or lichenified pruritic skin lesions. It is caused by direct  contact of an agent to the skin. It can be  caused  either by irritant triggers in 80 percent of patients versus allergic triggers in the remaining 20 percent of patients. It is estimated that more than 3700 substances can act as contact allergens.</p>

                    <p><strong>Eyelid</strong> dermatitis is most commonly due to ACD in one- half to two thirds of cases; culprits include fragrances( from facial tissues, cosmetics), preservatives, nickel and  (eyelash curlers), thiuram(rubber sponges, masks, balloons, toys), cocamidopropyl betaine and amidoamine(shampoos), tosylamide formaldehyde resin( nail polish ) and gold. ICD accounts for 15 percent of eyelid dermatitis, AD accounts for less than 10 %, and approx. 4% is attributed to Seborrheic dermatitis. Facial dermatitis can also be caused by allergens transferred from other parts of the body. Rarely, facial dermatitis may also result from airborne allergens including pollens.</p>
                    <p><strong>Hand</strong> dermatitis is common site for CD. ICD commonly presents as a localized dermatitis without vesicles in webs of fingers, the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the hand including the palms and the ball of the thumb. ACD often has vesicles ; locations include the finger tips, nail folds and dorsum of the hands. Often times ICD can precede development of ACD and can manifest as increasing dermatitis from web spaces to fingertips or from palms to dorsum surfaces. Hand dermatitis is seen more commonly in patients with atopic dermatitis than the general populations: it is also more common in older patients likely due to the frequent and repeated hand washing and occupational insults.</p>
                    <p><strong>Foot</strong> Pre disposing factors for food dermatitis include heat, humidity, and friction. Like hand dermatitis, patients with AD are also pre disposed to food dermatitis. Other causes of food dermatitis include tinea pedis, Psoriasis, dyshidrosis and Nummular eczema. Food dermatitis secondary to ACD frequently has lesions located on the dorsum of the feet and toes but can also have involvement of the sole and calcaneus. The inter digital areas are rarely involved. In a series of patients with foot dermatitis undergoing Patch testing 70% of patients had atleast one positive allergen on patch test; Nickel sulphate and Mercaptobenzothiazole had the most no of positives. Allergens pertinent to ACD of the foot include Rubber compounds, Leather, Adhesives or Glues, textile dyes and Nickel used in Buckles. Perioral dermatitis may result from habits such as lip licking, lip chewing or thumb sucking. Allergens in dental care products [ toothpastes and mouth washes] or chewing gum include cinnamon and peppermint. Balsam of Peru and cinnamic aldehyde are often used as a flavoring in food  products, lipstick, mouth wash and dentifrices. Patients may also have contact dermatitis in mucous membranes to orthodontics/ dental implants that contains metals such as nickel, cobalt, chromate, mercury and gold. Thus PT for oral dermatitis should also include metals, fragrances and preservatives.</p>

                    <p>History is an important aspect to consider in evaluating patients with  contact dermatitis. Particular attention should be paid to exposures at work [specific chemicals, vapors, fumes, food exposures, frequent hand washing], hobbies at home [gardening, painting, photography], and exposures at home [pets/ pet products]. Alleviating and aggravating factors should be addressed as well.</p>

                    <p>Patch testing is the gold standard for identification of a contact allergen and is indicated in any patient with acute and chronic pruritic, eczematous lichenified dermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected. Allergens are placed in chambers  that are applied to the skin[ particularly the back away from the spine] and good adhesion  between the allergens and the skin is necessary. The back should be free of hair, emollients and other dermatitis.</p>
