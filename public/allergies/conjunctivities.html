                  <p>Allergic conjunctivitis is one of the most common and treatable eye conditions in children and adults. Often called “pink eye,” it is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelid and the white of the eyeball, and helps keep the eyelid and eyeball moist. Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Allergens that may be present indoors or outdoors can cause eye allergies. The most common outdoor airborne allergens are grass, tree and weed pollens. People who are sensitive to these allergens suffer from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, the most common type of eye allergy.</p>
                    <p>Pet hair or dander, dust mites and moulds are the most common indoor allergens. These indoor allergens can trigger symptoms for some people throughout the year, resulting in perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Cigarette smoke, perfume and diesel exhaust may inflame your eyes. They can act as irritants that cause non-allergic symptoms, or they can make your allergic response worse.</p>

                    <p>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) constitute the remaining subtypes of allergic conjunctivitis, and are grouped together in Chronic Conjunctivitis.</p>

                        <p>It affects about 1 in 100 contact lens wearers. The exact cause of the inflammation is unclear -it is possibly an allergic reaction to debris caught behind a lens or due to poor lens hygiene.

                        <p>AKC is a bilateral inflammation of conjunctiva and eyelids, which has a strong association with atopic dermatitis.

Symptoms may regress with advancing age. Approximately 3% of the population is afflicted with atopic dermatitis, and, of these, approximately 25% have ocular involvement.</p>

                      <p><strong>General measures</strong><br/>The following can be useful whatever the cause of the allergic conjunctivitis:
                      <ul>
                      <li><strong>If you use contact lenses:</strong> in general, do not wear lenses until symptoms have gone, and for 24 hours after the last dose of any eye drop or ointment. However, your doctor or optician (optometrist) will advise if you can wear lenses with certain types of drops.</li>
                      <li><strong>Try not to rub your eyes,</strong> as this can cause more inflammation.</li>
                      <li><strong>Bathing the eyes</strong> with an over-the-counter ‘eye bath’ may ease symptoms.</li>
                      <li><strong>Avoid the cause of the allergy</strong> if possible. For example, if you have seasonal conjunctivitis then during the hay fever season try to avoid pollen by staying indoors as much as possible. Close windows, drive with windows shut and internal air circulation on in your car, and by wear wrap-around sunglasses when out.</li>
                      </p>
                      <p>In addition to the general measures described above:</p>
                      <p>Eye drops that reduce the allergic reaction are often prescribed. Tablets may also be prescribed. All medicines should only be taken under medical supervision.</p>
                      <p><strong>Antihistamine eye drops - </strong>these are usually needed only twice a day. They have few side-effects and can be very effective in reducing symptoms.</p>
                      <p><strong>Mast cell stabiliser eye drops -</strong> these have been around for a long time. They are also very effective and relatively free from side-effects. They need to be used frequently, as they are shorter-acting: four times a day or more.</p>
                      <p><strong>Combination anti-allergy drops -</strong> These combination drops are not suitable for everyone. For instance, children under 12 and patients with raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma) should not use them. Your doctor or pharmacist can advise if they are safe for you.</p>
                      <p><strong>Antihistamine tablets -</strong> These are taken to try to generally lower the allergic response in your body</p>
                      <p><strong>Steroid eye drops -</strong> Steroid drops are very effective in eye irritation. They calm down irritation and inflammation quickly. However, they increase the risk of eye infection, which can rapidly become severe in the presence of steroid drops. They can also lead to glaucoma. Therefore they should only be used if other treatments fail, and they are normally only used under the supervision of an eye specialist.</p>
                      <p><strong>Eye drops and contact lenses -</strong> most drops contain preservatives. However, in some cases preservative-free versions are available, as the preservatives may also cause eye irritation or allergy! Soft contact lenses should not be worn whilst the drops are being used, as the preservatives can be absorbed into the lenses and can further irritate the eyes.</p>
