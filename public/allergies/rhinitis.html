                  <p><strong>What is allergic rhinitis?</strong></p>
                  <p>Allergic rhinitis is defined as allergic symptoms in the nasal passage. Allergic rhinitis can be seasonal [occurring during specific seasons] or perennial [occurring year round].</p>
                  <p>The allergens that most commonly cause seasonal allergic rhinitis include pollens from trees,grasses and weeds, as well as spores from fungi and moulds. The allergens that most commonly cause perennial allergic rhinitis are house dust mites, cockroaches,animal dander,and fungi or moulds. Perennial allergic rhinitis tends to be more difficult to treat.</p>
                  <p><strong>How does allergic rhinitis occur?</strong></p>
                  <p>This condition occurs when allergens (allergy- causing substances) come into contact with the nose, and usually also the ears, sinuses, and the throat.</p>
                  <p>When allergens come in contact with the lining of the nose and sinuses, they trigger the cells to release the chemical histamine, which causes the allergy symptoms described below.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>Dust mites are cosmopolitan organism which is only 8 micron in size , too small to be seen with the naked eye and lives in human habitation. They are eight – legged  and sightless, and live on human debris. Mites excrete partially digested  food and digestive  enzymes as a fecal particle, which release allergens very rapidly. They are a common cause of asthma and allergy symptoms.</p>
                  <p>By being so similar to pollen grains, they are just the right size to cause allergies. Dust mites become a part of our environment and lifestyle because of their natural adaptations. Since they are entirely dependent on ambient humidity for hydration, and they are unable to search for environmental water supplies, they tend to live in places that “store” water. This may include carpets, sofas,mattresses  and clothing. As humidity falls, mites withdraw from the surface and migrate to where there is more humidity; eg., deeper in the mattress. Even in very dry conditions it may take months for mites to die and for their allergen levels to fall.</p>
                  <p>Avoiding contact with dust mites is the best way to protect against dust mite allergies. This can include the use of dust mite covers on bedding, as well as HEPA or statically charged air filters (HEPA filters are typically more effective in combating dust mites). Immunotherapy, and medication can help sufferers.</p>

                  <p>What causes dog dander allergy?</p>
                  <p> It is not the dog's hair or fur that is the real problem.Instead, people are usually allergic to the dander flakes of dead skin. Dander is a particular problem because it is very small and can remain airborne for long periods of time with the slightest bit of air circulation. It also collects easily in upholstered furniture and sticks to your clothes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>What are the symptoms of dog dander allergy?</p>
                  <p> The symptoms of dog allergies are usually like those of any other nasal allergy. They include;</p>
                  <ul class="browser-default">
                   <li>Coughing and wheezing</li>
                   <li>Red, itchy eyes</li>
                   <li>Runny, itchy, stuffy nose</li>
                   <li>Sneezing</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Some people, with dog allergy also have skin reaction. For instance,their skin might break out where a dog licks them. Others with more severe allergies might develop hives on their face or chest. People with asthma as well as pet allergies can have especially serious symptoms.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>How can you diagnose dog dander allergy?</p>
                    <p>Your doctor can do either a skin test or a blood test that will detect allergen- specific IgM [immonoglobulin E] to find out if you suffer from a dog allergy.</p>
                    <p>Even if you have pretty certain that you are allergic, testing is a good idea.Some people who assume that they have a dog allergy turn out not to have them. Instead, they are allergic to pollen or mould that the dog is carrying in on its coat from outside.</p>

                  <div class="col-md-12">
                      <p>How do you treat dog dander allergy?</p>
                      <p>Dog allergy can be  treated  with standard allergy drugs. You doctor might recommend antihistamines, decongestants, corticosteroid nasal sprays. Allergy immunotherapy is another option for people with dog allergy.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>Patients allergic to cats are allergic to the cat's saliva. However, typical allergic symptoms are not as a result of coming in direct contact with the cat's saliva. Instead, when the cat grooms itself by licking its fur and skin it deposits its saliva. The saliva dries, leaving behind the protein antigen that are the source of allergy to cats. These allergens  [cat saliva antigens] are very lightweight, and are easily aerosolized. Once air- borne the antigen can spread to clothes, furniture, carpeting, or any other household item.</p>
                  <p>Once cat allergy is confirmed, the best way to decrease allergy symptoms is to remove the cat from the home.  How ever, relatively high concentrations of cat antigen can remain, even months after the cat is removed. Thereby it is important to clean or replace the carpeting, furniture, and all other material that may harbor the cat saliva antigen.</p>
                  <p>Thankfully, there are less dramatic means to improve or eliminate cat allergy symptoms as well, including the use of medications and allergy immunization.  HEPA[high efficiency particulate air]  filters can catch particulates as small as  one micron, and are effective in combating cat allergens.</p>

                  <p>Cockroaches, especially the German Cockroach, are a very common pest in crowded cities worldwide. Recent studies have shown exposure to roach droppings as a major risk factor for the development of allergies and asthma in the inner city. Avoidance consists of cockroach baits and traps, extermination and cleanliness. This includes, not leaving food out in open containers, washing dishes after each meal, and keeping cupboards free of food debris.</p>
