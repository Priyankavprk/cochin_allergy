                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Dr Molly started this clinic in2015 , in view  of lack of specialized care for the patients suffering from asthma and other allergy related conditions in Ernakulam. As per the WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION (WAO), India lacks the Specialist doctors in the field of Allergy.</p>
                    <p>Large number of adult as well as Paediatric patients suffering from Asthma, allergic rhinitis, skin allergies like Urticaria and Angioedema, eczemas, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and food allergies are getting treated in the clinic currently. A thorough evaluation includes a comprehensive allergy history and physical examination. Extensive allergy skin testing for both aeroallergens and food allergens to identify the particular allergens causing the patient’s symptom are done. Blood  tests, Patch testing for various contact allergens, Lung Function Testing or Spirometry are also done where ever indicated. Based on the above test results, doctor makes individualized treatment  plans that includes pharmacotherapy, advice regarding avoidance measures and specific targeted allergen immunotherapy.</p>
                    <p>Immunotherapy provides long lasting immunity by modifying the patient’s symptoms upon exposure to the relevant allergens, thereby reducing the need for medications like inhalers. For eg: a child with allergic rhinitis will be prevented from getting asthma if immunotherapy is instituted early. This method treats the root causes of allergy problems by inducing a natural immunity to the allergens. Medications are also given to keep the symptoms under control which are gradually reduced and stopped. All these are done systematically with patient reminders for regular follow ups.She is a specialist in Allergen Immunotherapy in Kerala and follows the US and European Immunotherapy protocols.</p>
                    <p>Dr Molly’s Allergy and Asthma Centre provides exceptional medical care to the patients through the advanced  medical knowledge and up-to-date diagnostic and treatment modalities  and is  a leading provider of healthcare services in the field of Allergy  in  Cochin. Patients from other parts of the country and abroad  have benefitted from the specialized treatment available in the clinic.</p>
